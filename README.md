I created 10 different levels with an MSSQL database, and for each level, I wrote 3 questions from my general knowledge, ranging from easy to difficult, resulting in a total of 30 questions. You can create unique quizzes by randomly selecting questions within each levelâ€™s question pool. The best feature of this project is that it allows you to increase the number of questions for each level by adding them to the database, providing opportunities to further develop the project..!
